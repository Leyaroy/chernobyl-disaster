## This Project will outline and highlight key information about the The Chernobyl disaster 
The Chernobyl disaster was a nuclear accident that occurred on 26 April 1986 at the No. 4 reactor in the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, near the city of Pripyat in the north of the Ukrainian SSR in the Soviet Union. It is the worst nuclear disaster in history both in cost and casualties 

## **Cause:** 

Reactor design flaws and serious breach of protocol during simulated power outage safety test

## **Date:** 

April 26, 1986

## **Outcome:** 

INES Level 7 (major accident) see Chernobyl disaster effects

## **Location:** 

Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, Ukraine

The Project calls for the student to highlighting Success,Failures and Consequences due to this Disaster. Politics around 

## **Successes:**

1. ##Almost successful powerplant.
   * Consisted of the RBMK-10000 design, Units were contructed in 1977. RBMK reactors were of a pressure tube design that used enriched uranimum doxide fuel to heat water creating steam that drives the reactors' turbines and generates electricity.

## **Consequence:**

1. ##item
   * The reactors were highly unstable at a low power, due to control rod design, these factors contributed to an uncontrollable power surge that led to a series of blasts, at 1:24am. Which blew off the reactors heavy, steel, concrete lid.

2. ##Released plume of radiation.
   * Because of the Chernobyl powerplant blowing up it sent a cloud of radioactive dust billowing across nothern and western europe, reaching as far as eastern United States. Many radioactive particles were released into the air this caused many illnesses including cancer and high radiation sickness. more than 50 dozen had fallen ill, 31 documented dead during the explosion, some dying later due to these affects.

3. ##Long term effect on the earth.
   * In present day it effects our enviroment by. Fears remain that the world's worst nuclear disaster could still trigger cancer, illness and more deaths.
