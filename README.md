## **Cause:** 

Reactor design flaws and serious breach of protocol during simulated power outage safety test

## **Date:** 

April 26, 1986

## **Outcome:** 

INES Level 7 (major accident) see Chernobyl disaster effects

## **Location:** 

Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, Ukraine

The Project calls for the student to highlighting Success,Failures and Consequences due to this Disaster. Politics around 

## **Successes:**

1. ##Almost successful powerplant.
   * Pressure tube design that used enriched uranimum doxide fuel to heat water creating steam that drives the reactors' turbines and generates electricity.

## **Consequence:**

1. ##item
   * Fire caused inside the power plant.
   * Power surge led to a series of blasts, at 1:24am. Which blew off the reactors heavy, steel, concrete lid.
   * 
2. ##Released plume of radiation.
   * Sent a cloud of radioactive dust billowing across nothern and western europe, reaching as far as eastern United States.
   * This cause many illnesses. around 50 dozen people were exposed to cancer or high radiation sickness, only 31 were documented dead due to the explosion. Many later died due to a sickness.
3. ##Long term effect on the earth.
   * In present day it effects.
